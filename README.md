# GenAI_Hands_On
This repository contains hands-on exercises and demo notebooks for a workshop on Generative AI in Industry. Participants will explore both Generative AI and Agentic AI through practical, domain-focused use cases.

# GenAI Hands-On
A practical repository for hands-on exploration of Generative AI technologies and applications.

## Overview
This repository contains tutorials, code samples, and projects that demonstrate how to work with various Generative AI models and techniques. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced developer wanting to implement advanced use cases, this repository offers practical examples to help you build your GenAI skills.

## Contents
- Tutorials: Step-by-step guides for working with LLMs, DSPy, LLM-RAG, Agentic AI and other generative techniques
- Notebooks: Interactive Jupyter notebooks with complete examples
1. Product_Description_Generator.ipynb:  Learn how Generative AI (Google Gemini) can generate product descriptions in different tones and see how temperature settings affect creativity.
2. Intro_DSPy.ipynb : You will learn about the role of language models (LMs) / GenAI, how DSPy Signatures and Modules are used (Predict, ChainofThought, RAG, ReAct)
3. Gen_AI_in_Industry.ipynb : Generative AI in Industry — Maps + FMCG with DSPy & Agentic Pipelines

We’ll use SunBurst Orange Juice as an example product.
